# Contributing

If you wish to contribute a feature or bug fix, please open an issue first. From the issue it will be decided if said feature should be implemented or if the bug can be verified and reproduced. This way you can avoid submiting code for a feature just to have it rejected because the feature isn't wanted. After it is decided the bug fix/feature should be added, make the code changes required and submit a pull request refferencing the issue.

Having proper test cases for your pull request in test/check.pl would be appreciated.

If a new CLI flag is added or some other change that effects user interaction, please update the man page (`sm.1`) and the README.
